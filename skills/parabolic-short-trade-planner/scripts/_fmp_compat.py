"""FMP ``/api/v3`` → ``/stable`` URL compatibility shim.

FMP retired the legacy ``/api/v3/`` surface on 2025-08-31; API keys issued
after that date receive ``403 "Legacy Endpoint"`` on every ``/api/v3/`` request.

This helper rewrites a legacy v3-style URL (and its params) to the ``/stable``
equivalent. It is applied ONLY at construction points that build hardcoded v3
URLs and are *not* part of an explicit stable→v3 fallback list. Methods that
already iterate a ``_FMP_ENDPOINTS`` stable→v3 table must NOT route through this
shim, or the v3 fallback entry would be rewritten back to stable and the
fallback contract would break.

Note on endpoint naming: ``/stable`` accepts both underscore (legacy-style) and
hyphen (modern) names, but for several endpoints the underscore variant is free
while the hyphen variant is paid-gated (e.g. ``economic_calendar`` vs
``economic-calendar``, ``stock_news`` vs ``news/stock``). The rewriter preserves
underscore names to keep free-tier access working.
