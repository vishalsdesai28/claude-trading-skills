# Ticker Enricher
{: .no_toc }

Enrich ticker signals with company metadata (name, sector, industry) and prices (recommendation-date price, current price) from Yahoo Finance. Reads the social-signal vault index and emits a records file ready for a generic writer (e.g. write-supabase); the dashboard derives gain % and days held from the stored prices/dates. Reusable by any producer that has tickers.
