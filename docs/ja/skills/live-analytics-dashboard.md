# Live Analytics Dashboard
{: .no_toc }

Render another skill's reports/*.json (watchlist, breadth, or portfolio monitors) as a dashboard. Use when the user wants to visualize a screener/monitor result as a web page or a live-refreshing intraday monitor. Prefer the built-in Artifact tool for snapshots; escalate to a local FastAPI + polling serve stack (fixed port 8770) only when data must refresh live. Every generated page is CSP-safety gated (no inline handlers, addEventListener only) before serving.
