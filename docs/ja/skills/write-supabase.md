# Write Supabase
{: .no_toc }

Generic Supabase table writer. Reads a records JSON file (array or {records:[...]}) and upserts or inserts the rows into a Supabase table named on the command line, with a caller-supplied conflict key. Knows nothing about any domain — every workflow points it at its own table and details, so it is reusable across the whole repo. Use as the final "persist to Supabase" step after a producer emits a records file.
